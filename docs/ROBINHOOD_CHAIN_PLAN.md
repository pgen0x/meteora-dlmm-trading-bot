# Robinhood Chain Support — Research & Implementation Plan

Status: **planning** (branch `feat/robinhood-chain-support`, 2026-07-13)

## 1. What Robinhood Chain is (research summary)

- Ethereum L2 on the **Arbitrum Orbit** stack, public mainnet since **2026-07-01**.
  Chain ID **4663**, native gas token **ETH**, ~100 ms block times, settles to
  Ethereum. Public RPC: `https://rpc.mainnet.chain.robinhood.com`, explorer:
  `robinhoodchain.blockscout.com` (Blockscout, REST + JSON-RPC APIs).
- Fully EVM-compatible. Docs: `docs.robinhood.com/chain/`.
- **Uniswap v2 / v3 / v4 + UniswapX live from day one** — Uniswap is the
  primary AMM. First-week DEX volume crossed **$500M/24h**, driven by WETH
  pairs and a memecoin wave (~193k daily active addresses by 07-08).
- Launchpad ecosystem (the "pump.fun layer" that feeds new pools):
  - **Noxa.fun** — deploys ERC-20 **directly into a Uniswap v3 pool**
    (single-sided, 1% fee tier, LP locked) in one tx; "graduation" is only a
    milestone, not a migration. Standard v3 interfaces → trivially botable.
    1.8k → 6.7k token deploys in days.
  - **hood.fun** — fair-launch bonding-curve platform for the chain.
  - **pump.fun** added Robinhood Chain support (cross-chain).
- Tokenized stocks (AAPL/NVDA/... "Stock Tokens") trade 24/7 on Uniswap —
  separate, lower-volatility opportunity class from memecoins.

### Data/infra availability (maps to our current dependencies)

| Need (Solana today) | Robinhood Chain equivalent | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Meteora discovery API | **GeckoTerminal** `/networks/robinhood/new_pools` (+ `/pools` trending) | 48h window, public tier 30 req/min; also mirrored via CoinGecko `/onchain` paid tier |
| DexScreener momentum gate | **DexScreener supports `robinhood`** chain slug (`dexscreener.com/robinhood`) | `momentum.go` mostly reusable — same API, different chainId |
| Jupiter token audit | **GoPlus Token Security API** (60+ EVM chains; verify 4663 support) + **honeypot.is** | honeypot/sell-tax simulation is the EVM must-have; Blockscout API for holder distribution & contract verification |
| GMGN smart money | **GMGN fully supports Robinhood Chain** (web/app/API, `gmgn.ai/security?chain=robinhood`) — confirmed 2026-07 | reuse `gmgn.go` with chain param; GMGN security data can also backstop the honeypot gate |
| Meteora DLMM SDK (JS executor) | **Uniswap v3 `NonfungiblePositionManager`** (mint/increase/decrease/collect) via viem + `@uniswap/v3-sdk`; v4 SDK later if needed | v3 first: Noxa launches land on v3, position model closest to DLMM bins |
| Solana wallet | EVM keypair; gas in ETH; capital in **WETH** | Need bridge step to fund; ERC-20 approval hygiene |

## 2. Strategy fit

Same alpha thesis as Solana: catch newly-created pools early, LP into a tight
concentrated range, harvest fees, exit on velocity/trailing rules. Uniswap v3
concentrated liquidity ≈ DLMM bins (ticks instead of bins). Differences that
change behavior:

> True bin-based DLMM **does exist on Robinhood Chain**: AEON Protocol hosts
> LFJ (Trader Joe) **Liquidity Book** pools — the model Meteora's DLMM was
> ported from — plus Algebra Integral CL pools. But launch-week volume (and
> therefore fee capture) concentrates on Uniswap, and launchpads (Noxa)
> graduate into Uniswap v3. Primary venue = Uniswap v3; AEON Liquidity Book
> is a secondary venue to evaluate once its new-pool flow is meaningful.

- **Fee model**: v3 fee tier is fixed per pool (1% on Noxa launches); no
  dynamic fees like DLMM. Fee/TVL gate still computable from GeckoTerminal
  (`volume_usd` × fee tier ÷ `reserve_in_usd`).
- **Honeypots/sell-tax** replace Solana's bot-holder problem as the #1 rug
  vector → GoPlus/honeypot.is gate must be **fail-closed** for
  honeypot=true, unlike our Solana fail-open convention (missing data can
  stay fail-open; positive detection rejects).
- **Gas is cheap ETH, blocks 100 ms** → deploy latency dominated by our poll
  interval, not the chain.
- **One-sided LP above price** (our `single_sided_reseed` analog) is native
  in v3: mint with range entirely above current tick, token-only.

## 3. Architecture plan

Principle: **new venue package beside `internal/meteora`, not a rewrite.**
Scanner loop, dedup store, deploy runner, webhook forwarder are already
venue-agnostic in shape; screening/discovery/executor are venue-specific.

### Phase 0 — spike ✅ (ran 2026-07-13, results below)
- **GeckoTerminal** `/networks/robinhood/new_pools`: 200 OK, 20 pools/page.
  Dex split on sample page: 14 uniswap-v3 / 4 uniswap-v4 / 1 v2 / 1 virtuals —
  v3-first confirmed. Fields: `reserve_in_usd`, `volume_usd` +
  `transactions` + `price_change_percentage` per window (m5→h24),
  `pool_created_at`, `fdv_usd`, `market_cap_usd`. `include=base_token,...`
  adds name/symbol/decimals. **Caveats**: no fee-tier field (parse from pool
  `name`, e.g. "CALLIE / WETH 0.3%", or `fee()` via RPC); v4 pool `address`
  is a bytes32 pool ID, not a contract address.
- **DexScreener**: `latest/dex/pairs/robinhood/{pool}` works, standard
  schema → `momentum.go` reusable with chainId swap.
- **GoPlus**: chain 4663 **NOT supported** (code 2022). **honeypot.is**:
  not supported ("Invalid chain"). Both dead ends.
- **GMGN OpenAPI**: `chain=robinhood` fully supported with existing
  exist-auth. `/v1/token/info` returns complete `wallet_tags_stat` /
  `stat` (rat %, bundler %, top-10) / `dev`, plus new useful fields:
  `launchpad`, `launchpad_status`, `trade_fee`, `standard`.
  **`/v1/token/security`** also live: `is_honeypot`, `is_blacklist`,
  `is_open_source`, `buy_tax`/`sell_tax`, `is_renounced`, lock info —
  fills the GoPlus hole. Fields are often `null`/`-1` (unknown) on fresh
  tokens → gate = fail-closed ONLY on positive detection
  (`honeypot=1`, sell_tax over cap), fail-open on null/unknown.
- **Blockscout API v2**: `/api/v2/tokens/{addr}` gives `holders_count`;
  `/holders` gives top-holder distribution. No key needed.
- **RPC** `rpc.mainnet.chain.robinhood.com`: live, `eth_chainId` = 0x1237
  (4663), batch JSON-RPC works.
- Still open: manual v3 mint + collect + burn (needs funded EVM wallet —
  do before Phase 2 goes live).

### Phase 1 — daemon: discover + screen + signal ✅ (landed 2026-07-13)
Implemented as a sibling package, not an interface extraction — the two
venues share the scanner loop, store and forwarder but their pool shapes
diverge too much for a common `Discover()` signature to earn its keep.
- `internal/robinhood/`:
  - `discover.go` — GeckoTerminal new_pools ×5 pages + trending_pools ×1,
    merged/deduped, Uniswap-v3-only. Pagination is load-bearing: launch
    velocity is ~7 pools/min, so ONE page spans ~2-3 minutes and anything
    old enough to pass MinAge has already scrolled off (first two smoke
    runs rejected 57/57 on age). 6 req/cycle « 30/min public budget.
  - `screen.go` — `Fresh` mode: WETH quote, age 3m–24h, reserve $8k–$500k,
    fee tier ≥0.25%, projected fee/TVL ≥5%/day (volume×tier — GT has no fee
    field), ≥30 txns + ≥12 buyers h1, buys-without-sells honeypot shape
    reject, FDV $20k–$50M, momentum gates on GT's own windows (no
    DexScreener call needed). Geometric-mean score like the degen score.
  - `safety.go` — GMGN OpenAPI `chain=robinhood` `/token/security` (honeypot/
    blacklist/sell-tax, **fail-closed on positive detection only**) +
    `/token/info` (rat/bundler caps reuse `GMGN_MAX_*`), Blockscout holder
    floor. GoPlus/honeypot.is dead ends per Phase 0.
- Config: `ROBINHOOD_ENABLED` (default false), `ROBINHOOD_DISCOVER_URL`,
  `ROBINHOOD_SEEN_TTL` (6h), `ROBINHOOD_MIN_HOLDERS` (50),
  `ROBINHOOD_WEBHOOK` (default false = **observe-only**: batches journal to
  the daemon log; the live Hermes prompt + deploy pipeline are Solana-only,
  so EVM payloads stay out of both until Phase 2).
- Store: dedup keys `rh:<mode>:<pool>`; schema documented in
  `docs/SIGNAL_SCHEMA.md` ("robinhood_pool_discovery").
- Unit tests: `internal/robinhood/screen_test.go` (gate matrix + security
  tri-state). Live smoke 2026-07-13: 61 fetched → 3 passed, fully enriched
  (holders, taxes, bundler %); rejects `reserve=50 fee_tier=5 too-young=3`.
- **Next**: run observe-only ≥3 days, calibrate `Fresh` thresholds from the
  journaled batches. Observed quirk to watch: copycat same-symbol launches
  (two CALLIE pools in one cycle) — the venue may need a PVP-style flag.

### Phase 2 — executor: deploy path (executor ✅ 2026-07-13; live spike + dispatch pending)
Landed: `assets/skill/scripts/uni_executor.js` (viem-only, no @uniswap SDKs).
Contract addresses verified on-chain (NPM.factory + NPM.WETH9 cross-checked):
factory `0x1f7d…2efa`, NPM `0x7399…e0d3`, SwapRouter02 `0xcaf6…5cb2`.
Strategies: `balanced_tight` (swap half, ±range% band) and `weth_below`
(one-sided WETH band adjacent to tick, no swap). Exact-amount approvals only.
Wallet: `EVM_PRIVATE_KEY` in profile `.env` accepts a dedicated 0x-hex key OR
the base58 Solana secret (ed25519 seed reused as secp256k1 scalar) — the
Solana-derived account is the current setup. Read-only + DRY_RUN paths tested
live. **Wallet funded 2026-07-13**: `0x94098ccD4536729AAEcc113C313E11926A5bec2d`
(Phantom-exported EVM key, standard BIP44 path — NOT the ed25519-seed-derived
stopgap account) holds ~0.00104 ETH (gas) + 0.0085 WETH (LP capital), both
bridged from BNB/SOL via Across/Mayan.

**Automatic dispatch landed** (commit f1504bf, `internal/robinhood/deploy.go`
+ `Scanner.robinhoodDeploy`): mirrors Solana's `DEPLOY_CMD` pattern exactly —
`ROBINHOOD_DEPLOY_ENABLED=true` makes the daemon pick the batch's
highest-`Score` candidate and mint it via `uni_executor.js`, bypassing
OBSERVE/webhook entirely. No re-ranking pipeline needed (screen.go already
scores every candidate) — picking is a plain argmax. Fails closed on any
`OpenPositions` read error and enforces `ROBINHOOD_MAX_OPEN_POSITIONS`
(default 1) before every deploy — **the only safety brake**, since Phase 3
(monitor/exits) does not exist yet: a deployed position stays open until
closed by hand via `uni_executor.js close --id N`.

Currently running in production with `ROBINHOOD_DEPLOY_ENABLED=true` +
profile `DRY_RUN=true` — dispatch triggers on a real qualifying batch but
mints nothing (paper mode), the safest way to observe the full pick→deploy
log path end-to-end before spending real WETH. **To go live**: remove/set
`DRY_RUN=false` in `~/.hermes/profiles/solanza/.env` once a DRY_RUN cycle has
been observed successfully.

**Remaining**: watch for a live DRY_RUN trigger to confirm the full path;
Phase 3 monitor exits (trailing TP/SL, fast-out — port the Solana rulebook).
- `assets/skill/scripts/uni_executor.js` (or `.ts`) — viem +
  `@uniswap/v3-sdk`: wrap ETH→WETH, swap for target token, mint position
  (two-sided `balanced_tight` analog and one-sided above-price reseed),
  collect fees, decrease/burn. Strict approval scoping (exact allowance,
  revoke on close).
- `dlmm_pipeline.py --from-batch` grows a `--chain` switch: same
  deterministic re-rank, dispatches to uni executor for robinhood signals.
  Keep per-mode floors/penalty weights separate from Solana's (fresh
  calibration, don't share Darwinian weights).
- Wallet: `EVM_PUBLIC_KEY`/`EVM_PRIVATE_KEY` in Hermes profile `.env` only
  (same secrets policy as Solana keys — never in repo).
- Start `DRY_RUN`, then tiny fixed size (e.g. 0.005–0.01 WETH) real deploys.

### Phase 3 — monitor: exits
- Extend `dlmm_monitor.py` with a chain-dispatch layer or add
  `uni_monitor.py` sharing the exit rulebook (trailing TP/SL, fast-out
  velocity exit, phantom-PnL guards). Position state from
  `NonfungiblePositionManager` + pool slot0 via RPC (no subgraph dependency
  in the hot path; Blockscout as fallback enrichment).
- PnL in WETH terms; fee collection cadence decision (collect on exit only,
  v3 fees don't auto-compound).

### Phase 4 — calibrate + harden
- Tune gates from Phase 1–2 journals (expect different scarcity profile than
  Solana casual mode).
- Rate-limit management: GeckoTerminal 30/min public — consider CoinGecko
  paid onchain tier if poll cadence needs it.
- Optional later: v4 pools (hooks introduce per-pool custom logic = new rug
  vector — needs its own safety screen), UniswapX, tokenized-stock LP mode
  (different regime: low vol, fee-capture only).

## 4. Risks / open questions

1. **GoPlus coverage of chain 4663** unverified — if unsupported at launch,
   fall back to honeypot.is or local simulation (eth_call a buy+sell probe).
2. **Sniper/MEV competition** on 100 ms blocks; we LP rather than snipe, so
   less exposed, but entry swaps need slippage caps + deadline.
3. **GeckoTerminal freshness/lag** vs Meteora's first-party API — measure in
   Phase 0; DexScreener `new-pairs` as cross-check source.
4. **Capital split** between Solana and Robinhood wallets — operational
   decision, not code.
5. Noxa's "LP locked" claim ≠ token contract safety — creator can still hold
   supply; holder-concentration gate stays mandatory.

## 5. Deliverable order

| # | Deliverable | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Phase 0 spike notes (API field samples, one manual v3 mint/burn) | — |
| 2 | `internal/venue` extraction, zero behavior change, tests | — |
| 3 | `internal/robinhood` discover+screen+safety, signal-only | 1, 2 |
| 4 | Schema + config + docs updates | 3 |
| 5 | `uni_executor.js` + pipeline `--chain` dispatch, DRY_RUN | 1 |
| 6 | Monitor exits for v3 positions | 5 |
| 7 | Live tiny-size rollout + gate calibration | 3–6 |
